# Max Flow problem 
This project implements the Edmond Karp algorithm to solve the max flow problem in a directed graph.

## User Manual:
step 1: open the graph.txt file and input the graph and capacity.
step 2: run main.py or main.ipynb.

## Note:
The visualization of graph and flow networks depends on the lib *pyvis* and *IPython*. Users should install them by pip.
